# CUDA_Spring2023
The companion git repo for my Spring 2023 CUDA course. The first week work is largely getting started with the two most common machine and deeplearning platforms Google Colab and Kaggle. Both are equally good but Kaggle provides more recent GPUs and provides a range of GPUs to pick from. Google Colab is limited to one GPU or a TPU. 

## Week 1
If you examine the Week1 folder your will see 6 jupyter notebooks. The first three do hello world in Google Colab while the later 3 do hello world in Kaggle. Feel free to get comfortable with both of these environments.
### update
@Qazalbash (Meesum) has shared OpenCL version of Week 1 code. Those of you who do not have an NVIDIA GPU, you can use the OpenCL version of codes. Thanks @Qazalbash (Meesum).

## Week 2
We extend our knowledge of CUDA slightly by getting to know how to initialize data on the device (GPU). We also see how to check for errors in our CUDA code. We also see how to add two numbers on the GPU and return the result from device (GPU) back to the host (CPU).

## Week 3
We extend our knowledge of CUDA by getting to know how to pass a large array of data on the device (GPU). We also see how to time code on the CPU as well as on the GPU.
